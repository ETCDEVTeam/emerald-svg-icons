Emerald SVG Icons
=================

> SVG Icons made out of lines.

Emerald SVG Icons are made just out of lines. Due to the minimalistic design approach, every symbol will be recognizable even in small sizes. You can tweak/adjust the css attributes: stroke-width and stroke to finetune the icons with your typography.

There is no ready-to-use implementation for the svg files yet.

You can see a simple inline-svg + css demo [here](https://ETCDEVTeam.github.io/emerald-svg-icons/example/).
